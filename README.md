# Pig-Alien
This is my first ever python program, written by me as a senior in High School. Due to my lack of coding knowledge at the time, almost everything is done using if statements. No functions, classes, dictionaries or even lists were used in the making of this program. 

The game is made in python 3, and uses the pygame library. All the sprites and logic were made by me.
